# EchoTrace
EchoTrace is a Python application that listens to system behavior instead of reading logs. It converts CPU, network, sensor, and timing patterns into sound signatures, revealing anomalies through rhythm and tone. Healthy systems sound coherent; failing ones sound wrong—letting humans detect issues faster than dashboards or metrics.
